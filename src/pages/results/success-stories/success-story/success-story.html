        <h3>Retired U.S. Army Veteran and IsaBody Finalist is Always Up for a Challenge</h3>
        <p>
          Sixty-four-year-old Abilio admits, "I was dreaming about the day that I could fully retire throughout my career, and I should
          have been happy when it happened. But I found myself with more free time and not too much to do."
        </p>
        <p>
          The U.S. Army veteran had never been in this position before. Always busy, he first retired from the Army in 1991 after spending
          20 years in active duty. To keep him intellectually engaged, he continued to work and contracted for the U.S Department
          of Defense in Iraq and Afghanistan. He then retired once again in 2013.
        </p>
        <p>
          This free time left Abilio overindulging in his favorite fare with plenty of wine on the side. At 219 pounds, he was at the
          physical peak of mental boredom.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I started gaining more weight than my body and frame were able to handle, which started to affect my lower back," says Abilio.
          "I thought my better days were behind me and physical decline was all I could look forward to."
        </p>
        <p>
          Little did Abilio know that the willpower he had gained in the Army would get him back to the height of his health and put
          him on a fulfilling journey.
        </p>
        <h3>Isa… What?</h3>
        <p>
          "I was always tired and sluggish until someone said, ‘Party time!’" explains Abilio. "Then one day while visiting my nephews
          in Florida at the beginning of February 2014, my nephew said he was going to start on products called ‘Isagenix.’"
        </p>
        <p>
          Abilio didn’t know what that was or what it did, but when he returned to visit his nephew a few months later the name certainly
          stuck.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I saw the extraordinary change in physique, energy, and stamina level in my nephew," laughs Abilio. "So I immediately said,
          ‘I’m in! Let’s get started with Isagenix!’"
        </p>
        <p>
          The U.S. veteran ordered the 30-Day Cleansing and Fat Burning System and immediately felt the positive effects of the products.
          His daughter Sharon was impressed by the physical change in her father, and decided to join Isagenix too.
        </p>
        <p>
          Abilio is even close to his healthiest weight—180 pounds—from his days on active duty.* "From the beginning, I saw the IsaBody
          Challenge® as a way for me to stay focused on my goal."
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, Abilio is at 187 pounds,* and he’s certainly not stopping there. Instead, he’s found a deeper meaning in his healthy
          living after retirement—one he never imagined.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Although I reached my physical goals, I rediscovered passion in my life, my mind, my body, and my soul," explains Abilio.
          "I am no longer a 64-year-old dreaming of escape: There is no mountain too high to climb and I realize that my
          highest life purpose is to help others do the same with Isagenix."

        <h3>No More ‘Skirting’ Around the Issue: IsaBody Finalist Fits Back into High School Attire!</h3>
        <p>
          Amy is a natural nurturer. As a stay-at-home mother of two, she consistently cares for everyone in her family—immediate and
          extended—including volunteering her time to care for others as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          "One of my favorite people in the world, my aunt, was diagnosed with cancer," explains Amy. "I was fortunate enough to invite
          her into our home, so she lived with my family for a period where we did the chemo treatments, the radiation, and
          everything else with us by her side." During this time, Amy admits that everything else in her life took the backseat
          for a couple of years.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I was worried about caring for my aunt, my kids, my house, and my finances," says Amy. "I was simply overwhelmed from always
          taking care of everything and everyone."
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, Amy’s aunt—lovingly nicknamed Aunt "O"—passed away in August 2013. With all of the stress coming to a head
          with her aunt’s passing, Amy, at a petite 5"1’, was at 166 pounds… the heaviest she had ever been. And she wasn’t
          going to stand for it anymore.
        </p>
        <h3>No More Quick Fixes</h3>
        <p>
          After dabbling in several "quick fixes," Amy had noticed a pattern.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I would lose a little bit—15 pounds at the most—and then I’d gain it back. It was just a back-and-forth cycle," says Amy.
        </p>
        <p>
          In April 2014, she was browsing through her Facebook feed when she noticed a post from her friend about Isagenix. The post
          showed a picture of Isagenix products and read: "I’m looking to get fit this summer!" Amy wished for the same as
          her friend.
        </p>
        <p>
          But she wanted it for more than just a season.
        </p>
        <p>
          "To be honest, I hadn’t even thought about losing weight for a long time," admits Amy. "I had tried so many different things
          before that I didn’t want to screw up again."
        </p>
        <p>Amy channeled her inner detective and applied some research; she knew that if she did Isagenix and the IsaBody Challenge®
          it would keep her dedicated for the long haul.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I gave myself a simple ultimatum: If I do it and it works—great. And if it didn’t work, then that was it," shares Amy. "I
          was just going to let myself be and figured maybe this was the body I was supposed to have after having two kids."
        </p>
        <h3>Now That's Dedication</h3>
        <p>
          When her 30-Day Fat Burning and Cleansing System shipment arrived in May 2014, Amy didn’t know what to expect.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I figured the stuff was going to come, I was going to do the system, and it was going to be fine!" laughs Amy. "Well, I
          opened the box and there was shakes, cleanses, and so much more, and I thought, ‘Oh my goodness.’"
        </p>
        <p>
          OMG indeed. Amy was filled with such a staunch commitment that after she put her children to sleep that night, she stayed
          up until 4 a.m. reading the manuals cover to cover many times over.
        </p>
        <p>
          "That package had me pumped!" exclaims Amy. "I woke up three hours later and knew my life was going to change that day… I
          had made a schedule, highlighted an agenda, and immediately signed up for the IsaBody Challenge to hold me accountable."
        </p>
        <p>
          It worked. Today, Amy’s lost nine pant sizes and is now 115 pounds.*
        </p>
        <p>
          Her favorite part? She’s kept a skirt from high school and hung it outside her closet every day during the Challenge for
          inspiration. "I firmly believe with my whole heart that Isagenix gave me the power to get me back into that skirt,"
          shares Amy. "And I can’t wait to wear that skirt onstage!"

        <h3>Cosmetologist Makes Lifestyle Change that Sticks</h3>
        <p>
          Angela was raised in a southern community where weight loss, exercise, and watching portions was not a priority. Food was
          celebrated and it was always at the center of any gathering, which made it hard for Angela to maintain healthy
          habits. When the South Carolina resident agreed to try Isagenix four years ago, little did she know she would make
          a lifestyle change for good.
        </p>
        <p>
          "At the time I was tired and working long hours as a cosmetologist," says Angela. "My nutrition was bad and I had about 50
          pounds that needed to come off. I felt depleted and disconnected. I was willing to try anything because I just
          wanted to feel better."
        </p>
        <p>
          After her initial 9-Day Deep Cleansing and Fat Burning System, Angela released weight and felt energized. The 53-year-old
          signed up for the IsaBody Challenge to stay committed to losing weight the healthy way. The support she got from
          the Challenge made her feel for the first time in her life that she wasn’t alone in her weight-loss journey.
        </p>
        <h3>On The Right Side of 50</h3>
        <p>
          Angela has successfully completed four IsaBody Challenges, released a total of 45 pounds,* and transformed herself on so
          many levels. The personal development and growth she’s experienced has helped her get through menopause, and cope
          with her daughter Esprit growing up and moving out. She was finally able to let go of the negative mindset that
          had weighed her down for so long. She no longer thinks twice about making healthy choices.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently in her fifth Challenge, Angela has been in maintenance mode since the fourth Challenge. The 53-year-old is holding
          onto muscle mass and keeping her weight down doing a mix of cardio, weight training, yoga and tai chi every day.
          To power her workouts and keep her going during long work days, the cosmetologist relies on IsaLean® Pro, Ageless
          Essentials™ with Product B® IsaGenesis®, Ionix® Supreme and one Cleanse Day every week.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Maintenance is easy because Isagenix is not a diet, it’s a lifestyle," says Angela. "When you make better food choices,
          you make better life choices. I fully understand that whatever I do or don’t do now is going to show up in the
          next five to 10 years in terms of my physical, mental, and emotional health."
        </p>
        <h3>A Woman on a Mission</h3>
        <p>
          The transformation she experienced with Isagenix has revealed a new mission for Angela. The hairdresser of more than 30 years
          is now ready to help women realize the possibilities in front of them and create a financial legacy through her
          Isagenix business, which she’s named Fuller Lifestyle.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I’m embracing the growth that comes with challenging myself physically, mentally, emotionally, and financially," says Angela,
          who credits her supportive husband Ron for easing her journey. This is not just for show or to win prizes or look
          physically different. Isagenix truly is a vehicle for transforming lives."

        <h3>Firefighter Discovers Another Way to Serve Others</h3>
        <p>
          At 55 years old, Billy is in prime physical shape. While decades as a firefighter have impacted his physicality, he believes
          Isagenix is ultimately responsible for his ability to stay young and effective in the force.
        </p>
        <p>
          Billy served as a firefighter in New Mexico for 25 years. After retiring in his mid-forties, he quickly changed his mind,
          and rejoined a firefighting team in Arizona, where he continues to serve now.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I missed the service so much," remembers Billy. "I missed helping people. I had this empty feeling in my heart and felt
          that I wasn’t doing enough for people. So, I decided to get back in the service."
        </p>
        <h3>Not Accepting Defeat</h3>
        <p>
          Years later, the combination of four knee surgeries, a hernia, and a torn rotator cuff and bicep threatened to end Billy’s
          firefighting career for good. Following his last injury, his doctor said Billy would require a 10-14 month healing
          time, and that he may not fully recover.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only did his injuries slow him down, but Billy also knew that statistically, firemen live only five to seven years after
          retirement. Fortunately, Billy’s son and 2014 IsaBody Challenge® Finalist, Will, encouraged Billy to try Isagenix
          to aid his recovery and improve his lifestyle. Billy knew that losing weight would help his body heal quicker,
          so he began Isagenix in February of 2014.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I’m not going to be in those statistics because of the way my health is now. The whole Isagenix program helped me so much
          in transforming my health," he says. Not only did Billy’s healthy habits help him recover from surgery in only
          seven months, he was able to return to his profession and once again serve as a vital member of the Scottsdale
          Fire Department.
        </p>
        <h3>The Power of Saving Lives</h3>
        <p>
          Nearly a year later, Billy decided to continue his Isagenix journey and join the IsaBody Challenge. He lost 37 pounds* during
          the Challenge and feels stronger than ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Looking good is a side effect of Isagenix. The main point of the products is that they help you feel good and live a healthy
          lifestyle. I want to show people that you can do this at any age if you put in the work. The only thing stopping
          you is you," shares Billy. Billy didn’t just hope to get his body back in prime shape, the main reason he kept
          going even during the difficult days came down to his desire to save lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I’ve always had the mindset that if I’m not in the best shape to save somebody’s life, I should not be a fireman, because
          I owe the people that."
        </p>
        <h3>Spreading the Good News</h3>
        <p>
          Now, Billy is in the best shape to transform lives as a fireman and also as an Isagenix Associate. His goal is to eventually
          retire from a respectable firefighting career and go full time with Isagenix.
        </p>
        <p>
          "As a firefighter, often we help people when it’s already almost too late," says Billy. "I see so many people out of shape.
          Many of them even have diabetes and high blood pressure. Now, I can help them before that."
        </p>
        <p>
          The always positive husband and father of two embodies what it is to be an IsaBody Challenge Finalist. His physical transformation
          was only the beginning, and now Billy hopes to "spread the good news" and move others—including his fellow firefighting
          team—to begin their own change.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You don’t want to just be alive. You want to be living," shares Billy. "Let’s live our lives to the fullest into our 70s,
          80s, and 90s."

        <h3>Hockey Player Gets Back on the Ice with Isagenix</h3>
        <p>
          Two years into college, everything looked great for hockey defenseman Caylen W. The long-time athlete began playing hockey
          at age four, was enjoying a hockey scholarship at the University of Vermont, and looking forward to a promising
          professional career.
        </p>
        <h3>Starting Over</h3>
        <p>
          "I thought I had my world made for me going pro, then in the blink of an eye, I lost everything," he remembers.
        </p>
        <p>
          A blow to the arm led to a hyperextended elbow, nearly tearing all of the ligaments and tendons. After six weeks of rehab,
          it was evident that his athletic abilities weren’t the same. Shortly thereafter, Caylen’s coach suggested he "move
          on."
        </p>
        <p>
          Following a failed attempt at the pros due to the injury, he returned to his home in Alberta, Canada and "shut down completely."
          Weeks went by and Caylen started to feel upset with how he looked and felt. He had lost his athletic build and
          was tired, sluggish, and depressed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Deciding to get his body back in check, he reached out to his friend Joel, who introduced him to Isagenix. Caylen decided
          then to join the IsaBody Challenge® and never looked back.
        </p>

          "It was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made," he says. "As the days went on, I saw results that no other products have
          ever given me. Isagenix completely blew out anything I’d ever tried before."
        </p>
        <h3>'Go Time'</h3>
        <p>
          He credits a huge part of his Challenge success to the endless support from friends, family, the START group, and the IsaBody
          Challenge team. In fact, one of the highlights of his journey was when START Founder and Vice President of Global
          Field Development Erik Coover commented on his pictures, telling him how great he looked.
        </p>
        <p>
          "It was ‘go time’ right then," recalls Caylen. "I knew I was going to make the best of this."
        </p>
        <p>
          And make the most of it he did. The 23-year-old completely transformed his body. He lost 28 pounds,* while building a solid
          muscular physique that he says is better than ever before.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an athlete, Caylen knows meeting his body’s nutritional demands are crucial. For that reason, he never goes without his
          IsaLean® PRO Shake mixed with Isagenix Greens™ and Ionix® Supreme. He also adds IsaPro® to his nutrition regimen
          for a protein boost.
        </p>
        <p>
          "As an athlete, you want extra protein, because you go a lot harder in the gym," Caylen explains. "Since putting on lean
          muscle, I also feel a lot faster and lighter on my feet when I’m skating."
        </p>
        <h3>Full Circle</h3>
        <p>
          Caylen’s next milestone came two days before the end of the Challenge. He was accepted to the University of Calgary, and
          shortly after, he received a call from the head coach of the University’s hockey team asking if he’d play for them,
          which of course, he enthusiastically accepted.
        </p>
        <p>
          "It’s funny how things come full circle," Caylen says. "What I least expected was how the IsaBody Challenge would turn out
          to be the most intense personal development course I have ever been through!"
        </p>
        <p>
          Caylen has brought others, including his younger sister, into the Isagenix family as well. He is looking forward to attending
          college and sharing Isagenix with others.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Anytime I can help somebody, it’s one of the best feelings in the world," he shares.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, Caylen’s hockey future seems promising, and his Isagenix career just as much. The START member looks forward to excelling
          in the START group as he grows his Isagenix business.
        </p>
        <p>
          His biggest tip? For those who may feel Isagenix may be too expensive for their lifestyle, Caylen says think again.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Don’t shy out on the price. When I came home, I was broke and I was able to make it work. Know that if you get just two
          people on the products, you’re on your way. There’s always that one bill that’s tough to pay off, and Isagenix
          can really help out."

        <h3>PE Teacher Reclaims Health and Becomes Powerful Role Model</h3>
        <p>
          For so long Ellen was trapped in a 296-pound body that made her feel ashamed. As an elementary physical education teacher,
          she struggled demonstrating basic skills to her students. Fueling her shame were daily struggles like crossing
          her legs, climbing the stairs, buckling a seatbelt on an airplane or feeling her daughter’s arms wrapped fully
          around her for a hug.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I had guilt about the time I wasted watching TV and the money I spent eating junk food," says Ellen. "I felt like a lazy
          mom, withdrawn wife, absent friend and hypocritical teacher. I had lost all hope of living the life I desired for
          myself and my family."
        </p>
        <h3>Mission to Reclaim Health</h3>
        <p>
          Ellen discovered Isagenix through her sister-in-law, Allison, who arranged a meeting with Life Coach and Personal Trainer,
          Susan. Both women were convinced that Isagenix was the right solution. Shortly after that fateful meeting, Ellen
          found in her mailbox what she believed was a sign to take action and she began her Isagenix journey.
        </p>
        <p>
          "My mission was to reclaim my health," shares Ellen. "I became determined to make a change and not accept the destiny of
          dying young like my brother who passed away from morbid obesity at age 39."
        </p>
        <p>
          Staying true to her mission, Ellen complemented her Isagenix nutrition plan by working out twice a week with her trainer
          and doing high-intensity interval training and fitness dance classes on her own.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her biggest struggle was the temptation of falling back on her old habits of emotional eating. She powered through with mental
          focus, determination, and having fun with the products. She even came up with her own special concoction called
          Ellen’s Energizer: a packet of Greens™, IsaFruits®, Ionix® Supreme and Lemon Lime Replenish™.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just a few days before beginning her second 30-Day Cleansing and Fat Burning System, Ellen signed up for her first IsaBody
          Challenge®. She grappled with the insecurity of people seeing her photos. "My trainer kept encouraging and pushing,
          but it took me releasing 25 pounds* to muster up the courage to take my first ‘before’ picture."
        </p>
        <h3>A Role Model for Her Students</h3>
        <p>
          These days Ellen isn’t shy about showing off her newfound strength, confidence, and 136-pound* weight loss. Her highlight
          reel includes running her first 5K, training for a half-marathon, celebrating her entry into the 100-Pound Club
          and showing her students how a real pushup is done. She isn’t stopping there. She’s already signed up for her third
          Challenge.
        </p>
        <p>
          "It feels amazing to inspire my students to be active and healthy through my actions,” says Ellen. "I was a collegiate athlete
          and my drive, athleticism, and competitiveness have resurfaced. It’s great to have that identity back."
        </p>
        <p>
          Ellen’s journey took her from feeling lonely and isolated to leading an active, healthy life full of friends and Associates
          who continue to teach her about the power of belief.

        <h3>IsaBody Finalist Says Adios to ‘Muffin Top’</h3>
        <p>
          "My parents were workaholics," describes 41-year-old James. "I was taught that in order to get ahead you had to put in more
          hours at your job which meant, unfortunately, more time away from the family."
        </p>
        <p>
          After James graduated from college with a degree in law and security, he quickly realized there were no careers available
          in that position in New Lowell, Ontario, where he and his family settled.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I fell into the electrical field through my wife and have been successful in operating my own company and managing eight
          employees for 10 years," explains James.
        </p>
        <p>
          James was on what he called "the tradesman diet." "My eating lifestyle included waking up in the morning, having a breakfast
          sandwich, and then getting home at 10 and having a smorgasbord of leftovers from suppers… and that was pretty much
          it."
        </p>
        <p>
          As he built his business, he spent much of his time driving all over town and overseeing his employees’ projects. James started
          slowly gaining weight which catapulted when he tore his ACL while playing soccer in 2011.
        </p>
        <p>
          Out of physical commission, the pounds started packing on. "I put on an additional ten pounds," describes the 5’7" Ontario
          native who was then 180 pounds. "It was honestly my daughter who gave me the motivation to lose weight."
        </p>
        <h3>The ‘Muffin Top’ Song</h3>
        <p>
          James is clearly dedicated to his family. Watching them succeed is his No. 1 priority, and he’s willing to do anything to
          provide for his wife, 15-year-old and 13-year-old daughters, and 9-year-old son.
        </p>
        <p>
          "My oldest daughter had this song on her cell phone called ‘The Muffin Top’ song," laughs James. "So every time I would take
          my shirt off, she would put on this ‘Muffin Top’ song, and I think that was the defining moment. Even though it
          sounds cruel, she’d say, ‘Dad, you’re kind of fat…’"
        </p>
        <p>
          It was an eye-opener for James — and with the support of his wife, — he decided not to let his injury, work, and yes, even
          "The Muffin Top" song get the best of him.
        </p>
        <p>
          "A box showed up at the door, and my wife simply said, ‘We’re going to do Isagenix together.’ So of course I had to prove
          her wrong."
        </p>
        <p>
          Simply put, his wife won. James’ energy went through the roof, he lost the weight, and went from a 34" waist to 31.*
        </p>
        <h3>Representing Tradesmen</h3>
        <p>
          "When you’ve been in the trade for 20 some odd years, you really feel your body start to get sore after a hard day’s work,"
          explains James. "I saw the IsaBody Challenge® as a chance to represent tradesmen who were missing out on the great
          feeling that these products gave you after those long days."
        </p>
        <p>
          James originally got into the Challenge, he admits, for the guarantee of receiving $200 worth of products once he completed
          the Challenge. But his willpower and results behind the Challenge were, clearly, astonishing.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I started to get abs and that was huge for me!" exclaims James. "I’d never had abs before and I’d done everything I could
          before, but I never could get that sculpt. I feel fitter now in my 40s than when I was working out every day in
          my 20s. Even the guys at the gym were saying, ‘You’re really shredding down. What are you using?’"
        </p>
        <p>
          James was more than glad to share Isagenix products with his crew.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I was a nobody before, and all of a sudden I’m starting to get cut and even lift heavier weights," says James—which was
          a huge surprise to his wife. "She always said I was the strongest little guy she’s ever known… the ability to lift
          strong, made me feel better every time I lifted—that blows my mind!"
        </p>
        <p>
          With the IsaBody Challenge empowering the change in his body and attitude, James is also rethinking about the legacy he would
          like to leave to his children.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I just want to prove to my children that once you set a goal—that if you set your mind to something and really put it out
          there—and see it all the way through then you’ve done something amazing," he shares. "Isagenix has given me the
          ability to actually dream and give 100 percent at everything—my Isagenix business, selling the products, fueling
          myself with energy– everything!"

        <h3>Busy Father Gains the Mind and Body of a Competitor</h3>
        <p>
          Jesse has never been stronger mentally or physically, and after completing back-to-back IsaBody® Challenges, he’s now the
          guy at the gym everyone is watching. The father of three has managed to get his health and body in top form despite
          a super busy schedule acting as public safety chief for the local airport, running his family’s all-natural vegetable
          farm, and keeping up with three young kids.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Whenever I see myself in the mirror I have a slight moment of panic because I hardly recognize the image in front of me,"
          shares Jesse. "I continue to see new muscles forming, my body fat decreasing, and my energy increasing."
        </p>
        <h3>From Stressed to Ripped</h3>
        <p>
          "I let stress take over and felt my life being taken away from me one day at a time," shares Jesse. "I decided I was done
          feeling sorry for myself and that Isagenix would be my new beginning."
        </p>
        <p>
          The Montana resident’s hectic life kept him from working out as much as he liked, but after getting noticeable results from
          just using the products, Jesse signed up for his first IsaBody Challenge. He wanted to ensure that his busy schedule
          would not sabotage his new healthy lifestyle.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Challenge was instrumental in helping him set goals, then keeping him disciplined and motivated to follow through. At
          the end of 16 weeks, Jesse felt energized after releasing 26 pounds.* He was ecstatic over the positive changes
          in such a short time and finally felt like he was getting his life back.
        </p>
        <p>
          Riding high on his results and the momentum of his family and friends cheering him on, Jesse signed up for his second IsaBody
          Challenge with a goal to compete in a physique competition.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I switched from the Weight Loss President’s Pak to the 30-Day Cleansing and Fat Burning System with IsaLean® PRO to gain
          lean body mass," says Jesse. "My go-to now is the Athlete’s Pak. I do three IsaLean PRO shakes a day and two scoops
          of IsaPro® after a workout and before bed. I also cleanse twice a week."
        </p>
        <p>
          After the second Challenge, Jesse released 7 pounds of fat, gained 2 pounds of lean muscle, and was down to an impressive
          9% body fat from 28%.*
        </p>
        <p>
          The 33-year-old was rewarded for all his hard work with a third-place finish in his first-ever physique competition. The
          results qualified Jesse to compete on a national level and he plans to keep training and competing, an integral
          part of his life.
        </p>
        <p>
          "It was a lot of fun and it’s great motivation to stay healthy. Plus, Isagenix makes it easy," says Jesse. "A lot of other
          competitors were riding highs and lows in their energy but I felt great through the whole competition."
        </p>
        <h3>The Promise of Tomorrow</h3>
        <p>
          Jesse’s commitment to the Isagenix lifestyle has given him back his health and renewed his confidence. It’s hard to believe
          he was once a tired, stressed, and frumpy dad. The happy husband and energetic father you see today looks forward
          to playing with his kids and seeing a big smile on his wife’s face because he is once again an active member in
          his family life.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I’m in a great place physically and more importantly, mentally," says Jesse. "I look forward to my third IsaBody Challenge
          and what tomorrow will bring."

        <h3>Baby Boomer Energized by Isagenix Transformation</h3>
        <p>
          At 60, John is in the best shape of his life and ready to tackle the world. A natural go-getter, the railroad conductor and
          professional drummer lives a very active lifestyle filled with skiing, working out, running after his grandkids
          and playing in his classic rock, folk/rock, and jazz bands.
        </p>
        <p>
          On top of all of his hobbies, John works a physically demanding job as a conductor and also serves on the safety board and
          union for the railroad. But it’s this natural inclination to do more that finally got the best of him.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Being single, I just like to be active because it keeps me going," says John. "But I was getting sluggish, tired, and gaining
          weight. It took major effort for me to maintain all the activities I wanted."
        </p>
        <p>
          The Baby Boomer decided to give Isagenix a try after seeing fellow musician and 2009 IsaBody Finalist, Mike H., release several
          pounds after using the Isagenix systems. But he didn’t get serious about his health until he had officially reached
          burnout and depression set in. He committed to his first IsaBody Challenge as an extra push to feel focused and
          on track.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I took off 25 pounds* and felt energized," says John. "Cleansing was a big factor for me. Now I look forward to Cleanse
          Days because I know how I’m going to feel the next day."
        </p>
        <p>
          John was so happy with his initial success that he dove in to a second IsaBody Challenge. Although he suffered a back injury
          halfway through that left him unable to exercise properly, he was able to maintain his weight by increasing his
          Cleanse Days. He succeeded in finishing the Challenge and winning an Honorable Mention along the way
        </p>
        <h3>Youthful Aging Powered by Isagenix</h3>
        <p>
          While many of his peers are experiencing a decline in activity and health, John is at the top of his fitness game after completing
          four IsaBody Challenges. The 60-year old credits the addition of the Isagenix Brain and Sleep Support System and
          Ageless Essentials™ with Product B® IsaGenesis® to his Isagenix routine for his improved performance in the gym
          and behind the drums.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I truly believe that taking these products together has brought me to another level," says John. "I’m down to a size 32*
          and in the best shape ever."
        </p>
        <h3>Broadcasting Isagenix</h3>
        <p>
          John is looking forward to his retirement from the railroad this year to pursue his Isagenix business full time. The active
          single is committed to reaching Executive by Celebration 2015 and he plans to do it with meetings and Launch Parties
          targeting his peers.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I really want to let other Baby Boomers know that Isagenix is a great opportunity," says John. "If you’re looking to get
          in shape and stay young, as far as I’m concerned, this is the ultimate system that will take you there."

        <h3>Caregiver Proves Healthy Aging Plays a Pivotal Role Later in Life</h3>
        <p>
          At 53 years young, Kathy is happily married living in Hawaii. She and her husband honeymooned on the island of Kauai, fell
          in love with everything about it, and decided to call "paradise" home.
        </p>
        <p>
          They work together at a local assisted living community in an effort to give back. Kathy’s titles range from Joy Specialist
          to Happiness Facilitator to Social Butterfly – she likes to keep it fun for the residents, and considers them her
          family. She is the Business Office Manager. "But, we had fallen into a rut at home." recalls Kathy. "We were enjoying
          sitting back, relaxing, eating the wrong foods, and watching TV a little too much. We were not getting out and
          enjoying the island."
        </p>
        <p>
          It wasn’t until Kathy turned 50 that she decided to embark on an exercise regimen and lose weight.
        </p>
        <h3>Age is Just a Number</h3>
        <p>
          "From age 50 to 51, I was frustrated," shares Kathy. "Nothing worked. I had become an expert at not losing weight on numerous
          weight-loss programs."
        </p>
        <p>
          Then her yoga instructor shared Isagenix and the benefits behind the products.
        </p>
        <p>
          "She also encouraged me to take a few "before" pictures, to document my journey and upload them into the Challenge," says
          Kathy, "which I really did not understand. But I was so focused, I trusted her and did what she said."
        </p>
        <p>
          With an increasing number of failed weight-loss programs under her belt, Kathy was open-minded and seeking solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          "When I saw my initial ‘before’ pictures I started to cry," remembers Kathy.
        </p>
        <p>
          "They instantly became my motivation to get healthier. Anyone who thinks they don’t need to take a ‘before’ picture should
          think again. It could be the game-changer you need."
        </p>
        <p>
          Within three days of being on the 30-Day Cleansing and Fat Burning System, Kathy started to feel better, inside and out.
        </p>
        <h3>Third Time’s a Charm</h3>
        <p>
          That was three Challenges ago. Her incredible transformation has even been pictured in the 2013 and 2014 IsaBody™ Look Books.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I lost 28 pounds* during my first Challenge," says Kathy. "I was happy. I thought I was finished, so I considered myself
          in maintenance." But something strange happened. Before she could sign up for her second Challenge she shed an
          additional 11 pounds,* taking her slim 5’2" physique down to a toned 114 pounds. At the end of her second Challenge
          she dropped 3 additional pounds* for a final weight of 111 lbs. Then the third Challenge made it all so rewarding
          by being selected as a finalist before the end of the year. "I don’t use a scale often," admits Kathy. "I rely
          on how my clothes fit and how I feel."

          The regimen that brought her success? Two shakes a day…unless she is running late, then Kathy reaches for an IsaLean Bar.

          "I easily integrated Isagenix into my life. I was of the mindset that this was for life, so I wrapped my head around the
          concepts, and it worked!"
        </p>
        <h3>Forging Forward</h3>
        <p>
          Kathy recently signed up for her fourth Challenge. Her goal: Build more lean muscle.

        <p>
          "I see firsthand, every day, how things are for the elderly folks who took care of themselves. They are leading active, vital
          lives, and I want that kind of healthy aging for me," says Kathy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, Kathy has lost 39 pounds* and 40 inches* since starting her Isagenix journey.

        <h3>Former Pro Fitness Competitor Gets Her Pre-Baby Body Back</h3>
        <p>
          Two years ago, if someone had shown Kelli her "before" photo from the beginning of her 2015 IsaBody Challenge®, she would
          never have believed it. She was in top shape as an elite fitness competitor and had recently received her pro card.
        </p>
        <h3>Adjusting to Motherhood</h3>
        <p>
          When Kelli became pregnant with her first baby last year, she ended up gaining nearly 50 pounds. Even after giving birth,
          she retained much of the weight.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I understand why people are comfortable with where they’re at after having a baby," says the 29-year-old mother. "As a new
          parent, you don’t care about how you look, because everything is about the baby and you want to spend every moment
          you can with them."
        </p>
        <p>
          As the days went by, the Wisconsin-native began to feel down on herself and was too embarrassed to go back to the gym where
          everyone had known her during her fitness prime.
        </p>
        <p>
          In February 2015, four months after giving birth, Kelli decided that she couldn’t take it anymore. She "kicked it into gear"
          and joined the IsaBody Challenge. Her goal was to get her body back, not only for herself, but for her son as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I knew the only way I was going to be happy with myself and be a better mom was to have my confidence back," she remembers.Putting
          in the Time
        </p>
        <p>
          The new mother worked hard and got back into her gym routine.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I thought, ‘I’m going to get there, and I’m going to see the results. It’s just going to take time,’" Kelli recalls. And
          she was willing to put in that time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Within a few weeks, she started to notice her progress, empowering her to finish strong. Her fiancé, Jesse, stood by her
          side, successfully completing his own Challenge. Kelli felt a great deal of support during her transformation and
          now enjoys a body that rivals her former fitness competitor physique.
        </p>
        <p>
          "The biggest part of Isagenix is the positive people that are involved in the company," shares Kelli. "It’s amazing to me."
        </p>
        <h3>Reaching Goals</h3>
        <p>
          No longer confined to maternity jeans, Kelli comfortably wears her size 2 skinny jeans and feels that her stamina has greatly
          improved. This fall, she is hoping to compete in her first fitness competition since having her son.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kelli doesn’t let a day go by without properly nourishing her body. Specifically, she enjoys Ageless Essentials™ with Product
          B® IsaGenesis®, Ionix® Supreme, and nightly shots of Cleanse for Life®.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of her biggest tips for losing weight is to have a proper eating routine. "I never skip breakfast or dinner," she says.
          "I eat a shake, a bar, or other snacks or meals every three hours to build my metabolism."
        </p>
        <p>
          Kelli’s ultimate goal is to one day own a gym with her soon-to-be husband. She is in the process of getting her personal
          training certification so she can help others improve their fitness and nutrition as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I’ve had so many positive responses to everything that I’ve done," she says. "I want to be able to help others reach their
          goals as well."For more IsaBody success stories like Kelli’s.

        <h3>Father of Three Challenges Himself, Becomes an Inspiration to His Children</h3>
        <p>
          While facing unemployment and back surgery, Illinois-native Michael L. had lost hope. His nutrition was poor, he was overweight,
          and he had no energy for himself or his family.
        </p>
        <p>
          His trying situation came to a point where simply waking up in the morning seemed meaningless. "I couldn’t think of anything
          I had done to make the world a better place," remembers Michael. "I knew people counted on me, but I couldn’t be
          counted on."
        </p>
        <h3>A Life-Changing Decision</h3>
        <p>
          When Michael’s friend introduced him to Isagenix six weeks after his back surgery, his outlook was bleak. Michael turned
          it down, instead focusing on simply trying to get by. During his recovery, he realized his life was spinning out
          of control. Then, nearly six months later, Michael was introduced to Isagenix again. This time, it was his massage
          therapist who encouraged him to give the products a try.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Here were two different people who didn’t know each other but were both telling me the same story," he recalls.
        </p>
        <p>
          Praying this would be the change he desperately needed, Michael made the decision to try Isagenix.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I know September 4, 2014 is the day my life changed forever," tells Michael. "I knew four days into the program that it
          was different. I had more energy, and soon I began losing weight. I didn’t believe it at first."
        </p>
        <h3>Continual Progress</h3>
        <p>
          Even before he started working out, Michael lost 30 pounds* with his improved nutrition. He had started living the healthy
          lifestyle he’d always wanted. Suddenly full of energy and passion, he began to share Isagenix with everyone he
          could, including his wife and children. He was so encouraged by his success that he wanted to further his progress.
          "I thought, ‘if I’m going to talk the talk, I have to walk the walk.’ So I decided to join the IsaBody Challenge."
        </p>
        <p>
          During those 16 weeks, Michael lost an additional 21 pounds* and established an exercise routine that helped him achieve
          a stunning, chiseled physique.
        </p>
        <p>
          Michael was not the only one impressed by his results. His children watched as their dad became an even greater role model
          and a more involved parent.
        </p>
        <p>
          "This was the first time I can recall as a parent that I led by example," recalls Michael. "My son wrote a Facebook post
          saying, ‘Dad, you inspire me.’ I started crying right in the middle of the gym when I read it."
        </p>
        <p>
          Inspired by their father’s newfound resolve for health and wellness, two of his children quickly began using Isagenix products
          and have had their own amazing results. In fact, his daughter is currently building her business while attending
          college. Recently, Michael’s other son began his own Isagenix journey as well. Michael feels his proudest accomplishment
          is that of his family’s experience with Isagenix. Not only do his children share his passion, but he has also brought
          his wife and 80-year-old mother on board.
        </p>
        <h3>Reaching Out</h3>
        <p>
          During his Challenge, Michael took advice from the Isagenix pros, including 2014 IsaBody Challenge Grand Prize Winner Amyra
          Mondon. Specifically, Michael followed one of Amyra’s tips to hire a professional trainer. He also learned workout
          tips from coaches at Savage Fitness.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the support of his family, friends, and fellow Isagenix Associates, Michael looks and feels better than ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          "This is what I should have felt like in my twenties," shares Michael. "I feel like I’ve gained another chance. It’s a lot
          of fun!"
        </p>
        <p>
          Not stopping there, Michael now knows his newfound title of IsaBody Challenge Finalist will help further his ability to share
          Isagenix with everyone.
        </p>
        <p>
          "My passion is to help people get healthy," he says. "I feel great and other people should feel the same way. I know now
          that I am making a difference."

        <h3>Mom Now the Best Version of Herself</h3>
        <p>
          Before being introduced to Isagenix by a friend, Natalie was overweight and uncomfortable in her own skin. It seemed everything
          she was taught as a competitive athlete was not working anymore. Adding to her frustrations was the photography
          business she started so she could stay home with her son.
        </p>
        <p>
          "My business was floundering and it was taxing my relationship with my ever-supportive husband," shares Natalie. "I was feeling
          like a failure as a mom, like a wife with no zest for life, and a partner with no financial contribution."
        </p>
        <p>
          Desperate for change, Natalie took a chance and purchased her first box of Isagenix products with a credit card. After a
          couple weeks she already felt better. After a short period of time, she was already down 12 pounds and 19 inches.*
          She used the IsaBody Challenge to see what she could accomplish in 16 weeks.
        </p>
        <p>
          "The Challenge provided me the support to stay accountable. I could plug in my results and see weight getting lower and the
          inches getting smaller," shares Natalie. "And the $200 worth of free products is such a great incentive."
        </p>
        <h3>A Sparkling Red Celebration</h3>
        <p>
          The culmination of Natalie’s year-long Isagenix journey happened onstage in a sparkling red bikini. She slimmed down 46 pounds
          with back-to-back Challenges, the 31-year-old mother fulfilled her dream of competing in a bikini competition.
          At the end of it all, she’d lost 49 pounds,* 53 inches, and 15% body fat.*
        </p>
        <p>
          Natalie’s goal was to be the absolute best version of herself. Following the guidance of her friend, fitness coach, and Isagenix
          Millionaire Cathy, this first-time competitor switched her focus from weight loss to energy and performance.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I utilized the IsaLean® Shakes, IsaLean® Pro and IsaPro® as I prepared for the stage. I am so grateful for these incredible
          products. I’m in a size that I have NEVER been as an adult and I feel healthier and sexier at 31 than I did at
          21," declares the 2015 IsaBody Challenge Top Achievers Finalist.
        </p>
        <h3>New Body Leads to Booming Business</h3>
        <p>
          The bikini competition and dramatic transformation pictures from the IsaBody Challenge has flooded Natalie’s inbox with messages
          from people who want to know her secret.
        </p>
        <p>
          "The secret is, there is no secret," says Natalie. "I had wall-kicking moments and days where I wanted to throw in the towel.
          But I was dedicated to creating healthy habits and sharing my story. This is a lifestyle commitment and if you
          follow the system Isagenix has laid out, it works."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that she’s reached her ultimate fitness goal, Natalie is now excited about the prospect of having a second child-a dream
          she thought was not financially possible before Isagenix. The stay-at-home mom’s fast-growing business has allowed
          her to be present for her son while making a significant contribution to the household income.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I feel the best I have ever felt. The fact that it happened while I’m able to earn an income that will allow my husband
          and I to expand our family is something I can never repay. My life is forever changed."

        <h3>Mom Finds Way to Care for Herself, So She Can Care for Others</h3>
        <p>
          Most mothers believe in putting their families first, and many are so busy putting others’ needs above their own that they
          forget to care for themselves. For 28-year-old mother Nicole S., that’s exactly how it happened.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I was taking care of my son, my husband, and doing everything for everyone else all the time," remembers Nicole. "I lost
          myself in all of that."
        </p>
        <h3>The Perfect Gift</h3>
        <p>
          Trying to make time to improve her own health while caring for her young son, Bentley, proved challenging, as he struggled
          with certain feeding difficulties, which required additional time and effort for Nicole.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nicole’s mother, Tammie, had been using Isagenix products and had experienced an incredible transformation. When Tammie came
          to visit her daughter and grandson for Christmas, she gave Nicole the best gift she could—a box of Isagenix products
          to get her started on taking care of herself.
        </p>
        <p>
          "My mom asked me ‘what are you doing for yourself? You need to take care of yourself, that way you can take care of everybody
          else,’" Nicole recalls.
        </p>
        <p>
          Right away, Nicole began using the products her mom had given her, and she began to feel a noticeable difference.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I started having energy and sleeping better," shares Nicole. "My favorite product was the Ionix® Supreme, I still can’t
          go a day without it."
        </p>
        <p>
          Empowered by her goal to become a better mother through improving herself, Nicole committed to joining the IsaBody Challenge®.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the beginning, she focused solely on nutrition with Isagenix, not yet introducing exercise into the mix. Over time, however,
          she found that not only was she able to keep up with a toddler, but she also had enough energy to add a bit of
          exercise into her daily routine as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I’m excited to have the energy to exercise and stay active with my son," she says.
        </p>
        <h3>Refusing to Give Up</h3>
        <p>
          Nicole knew her resolve to take care of herself was benefiting her as a mother. "Things seemed to be getting so much better."
        </p>
        <p>
          Just when life seemed to be heading in the right direction, family problems arose. In the middle of her Challenge, Nicole’s
          husband left the family and moved out of state, leaving her to care for Bentley on her own. This proved to be an
          incredibly difficult time in her life, but Nicole knew she couldn’t stop moving forward.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I definitely knew that giving up was not going to be an option," she shares. "I was not going to give up myself, because
          I’ve become a better mom through this whole process."
        </p>
        <p>
          Nicole surged forward with her Challenge, and even began sharing Isagenix with others along the way. Despite this being a
          difficult time in her life, she showed the resilience it took to truly better her life.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I know that I wouldn’t have made it through as much as I did if I didn’t have this to focus on," she says. "It’s helped
          change us and make us stronger. This Challenge definitely saved our lives."
        </p>
        <h3>Stronger than Ever</h3>
        <p>
          Supported by family and friends, Nicole keeps her sights on being the best mom she can be. Tammie says she is "beyond thrilled"
          to see Nicole and Bentley experience a new life.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the conclusion of her IsaBody Challenge, Nicole had dropped 15 pounds* and gained a true passion for Isagenix products.
          That passion has led to her next goal: to share Isagenix with others and to grow her Isagenix business.
        </p>
        <p>
          "How can you not share this freedom with other people when it’s done so much for you"? says Nicole. "I believe in it. I believe
          in the products. I need to do this for me and my son and our future."
        </p>
        <p>
          Nicole hopes to move near her family in Florida and join Tammie in growing their businesses. They look forward to "throwing
          IsaParties for friends who want to experience Isagenix."
        </p>
        <p>
          Feeling stronger now than ever, Nicole’s biggest tip for others beginning their own journey is to remember where they started.
          She focuses on being supportive and helps them with researching product information. Most of all, she encourages
          them to join the IsaBody Challenge as she did.
        </p>
        <p>
          "No matter what you’re going through or what challenges you’re facing, if you just keep pressing forward, you can overcome
          anything and come out stronger and better on the other side."

        <h3>Through Sickness and Flood, IsaBody Finalist Proves He’s Up for Any Challenge</h3>
        <p>
          They say "when it rains, it pours." For Ryan, an Alberta-native, that was literally how it happened.
        </p>
        <p>
          In June of 2013, a massive flood hit Calgary, Alberta, devastating the area. Reported by the CBC as the most costly natural
          disaster in Canadian history, the flood displaced over 100,000 people from their homes. Ryan and his family were
          among those left homeless.
        </p>
        <p>
          "We were displaced from our home for two months, living at a friend’s house," recalls the father of two. "There was seven
          feet of water in the basement that ate away my basement floor. We had one of those IKEA shelves, the big thick
          ones—it was floating. The area in my basement was toxic and I didn’t want my kids there."
        </p>
        <h3>Better Health, Better Life</h3>
        <p>
          At the same time as the flood, Ryan was also suffering from a candida (fungal) infection in his digestive tract and a condition
          called adrenal fatigue.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Adrenal fatigue is very lifestyle-based," explains Ryan. "You have to hammer nutrition into your body because you run through
          it so much faster."
        </p>
        <p>
          Ryan’s candida illness had similar effects to the adrenal fatigue, which compounded the problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Brain fog is the most difficult symptom because you feel so disconnected. Loud noise made it worse, so in social settings
          I would be distant. This and irritability are the biggest issues, making me a very unpleasant person."
        </p>
        <p>
          The loving husband and father of two daughters, ages 7 and 4, has always prided himself first and foremost on being there
          for his girls. With his ailing body, it became an incredible struggle to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
          "There was a time when I couldn’t be myself for my kids," reflects Ryan. "It’s hard to admit that. It’s so hard to lose yourself.
          People don’t realize how bad it is unless you tell them."
        </p>

          The natural disaster compounded Ryan’s health issues as he attempted to repair the flood’s extensive damage to his house.
          Additionally, his profession as a Chiropractor added to the physical demands Ryan placed on his body. The 36-year-old
          knew he had to do everything possible to get adequate nourishment.
        </p>
        <p>
          "It was intense. I had no fuel left," remembers Ryan. "You’re just not yourself and you can’t find it in yourself to get
          it back."
        </p>
        <p>
          Back in 2013, Ryan and his wife Angela, met Angela M., who introduced them to Isagenix. Ryan was already interested in similar
          products, but with Isagenix, he found he was able to get everything in one place. He had no idea how much quality
          nutrition would help.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Isagenix provided me with the essential nutrition my body required, which assisted me with correcting my deficiencies,"
          tells Ryan. "It’s also what got me through the flood. I would come in and have my shake and I would keep going.
          That’s truly what allowed me to get through enough to do that."
        </p>
        <h3>A New Kind of Challenge</h3>
        <p>
          After a great deal of effort, Ryan and his family were able to recover from the devastation of the flood and return to their
          home. After seeing the impact Isagenix products had on his body, even through the many obstacles he faced, Ryan
          decided to take on a new challenge.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2014, with the goal to "be more," Ryan joined the Isagenix IsaBody Challenge.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I thought, ‘This is my chance,’" shares Ryan. "I’m going to give this a shot. The Challenge was perfect because it was going
          to hold me accountable and I was going to push hard."
        </p>
        <p>
          And he did. During the 16-week Challenge, Ryan regained his energy and toned his body, building 5 pounds of muscle.*
        </p>
        <p>
          "The IsaBody Challenge was not about loss for me, it was about the gains," says Ryan. "I gained back my health, my life,
          and my body."
        </p>
        <p>
          As a chiropractor, Ryan understands he is in a unique position to impact the health of others. He sees this as the perfect
          opportunity to share his story.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I talk about the IsaBody Challenge with all of my patients," tells Ryan. "Anybody that’s willing to listen. I find when
          people get on it, they have nothing but great things to say. And I love to hear that because I don’t want to just
          help them physically with treatments, I want to see their lifestyle change."
        </p>
        <p>
          Since completing the Challenge and overcoming major obstacles, Ryan has continued to improve his health. He sees Isagenix
          as a "lifestyle" and continues to use the products to properly nourish his body.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I got back the passion for life," Ryan says with a smile. "It’s about leaving your mark and making a difference for people
          in their health."
        </p>

        <h3>The Speed of Purpose: From Couch Potato to IsaBody Finalist</h3>
        <p>
          One day after work, Abby was reprising her role as a self-proclaimed "couch potato” when she came to a sudden and startling
          revelation—life wasn’t getting any better. She was in her early 20s and her life had already settled into an unfulfilling
          and unhealthy routine.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Every day became a carbon copy of the one before it," says Abby. "I went to work, grazed the fridge and cabinets for hours
          on end eating unhealthy snacks, then I’d plop down on the couch and watch TV until I couldn’t keep my eyes open,"
          confesses Abby. "I had no motivation."
        </p>
        <p>
          Nothing could move her. "My boyfriend would try to get me to go on walks or ride bikes," Abby remembers, "but I just wasn’t
          interested."
        </p>
        <p>
          Her ‘aha moment’ came when she saw pictures of herself from a friend’s party. "I saw pictures of myself and I was appalled,"
          says Abby, "I realized it was time to make a change–things weren’t going to get any better–I didn’t even recognize
          myself."
        </p>
        <h3>Abby’s IsaBody Motivation</h3>
        <p>
          Abby started with Isagenix in March of 2013. "I started using the 30-Day Cleansing and Fat Burning System," she says, "I
          started to see pretty fast results, and considered joining the IsaBody Challenge®."
        </p>
        <p>
          "My trainer suggested we do the Challenge, so that is exactly what I did to hold myself accountable," remembers Abby, "I
          never in a million years expected to be a finalist! I just saw that I needed to change my lifestyle."
        </p>
        <h3>Abby’s New Normal</h3>
        <p>
          Today, Abby’s routine is very different. "These days, I get a lot of compliments," She shares confidently, "especially
          during the final weeks of the Challenge."
        </p>
        <p>
          Abby talks about some of her favorite Isagenix products. "I take e+™ before every workout. Isagenix fuels my energy. I feel
          more alive and am more motivated and I’m so excited to tell others about Isagenix. Then there’s Ionix®. I can’t
          go a day without it."
        </p>
        <p>
          Friends and family have really noticed a significant change in Abby’s physique. "I frequently hear, ‘Wow you’ve really lost
          a lot of weight’ and I must say that feels good."
        </p>
        <h3>A Challenge For The Future</h3>
        <p>
          Being an IsaBody Challenge Finalist has changed Abby’s life. "I plan to compete in many other IsaBody Challenges," states
          Abby. "I love the discipline and it helps me stay focused, lowers my body fat percentage and reach a higher level
          of fitness."
        </p>
        <p>
          Abby is driven. "I love to share my story with everyone I meet. My goal is to build a business and help people. Isagenix
          is the perfect way to build both."

        <h3>Florida Fitness Instructor Gets Fit with Isagenix</h3>
        <p>
          "Life before the IsaBody Challenge® was frustrating," shares Amyra, a former Tampa Bay Buccaneers NFL Cheerleader and current
          group fitness instructor. "I was always active yet kept gaining weight. Then to be in front of a group, trying
          to help them get in shape and not being in shape myself, was exhausting and disappointing."
        </p>
        <p>
          Not to mention the not-so-exciting news she received from her doctor following her yearly physical.
        </p>
        <p>
          "The tremendous financial pressure my family was having, the stresses of motherhood, and the long hours my husband was working
          resulted in a lot of late-night snacking and me weighing 173 pounds," says Amyra.
        </p>
        <p>
          That’s when her good friend shared Isagenix.
        </p>
        <h3>Becoming Her Biggest Fan</h3>
        <p>
          "I immediately ordered the 9-Day Deep Cleansing and Fat Burning System and signed up for the IsaBody Challenge," she says.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first Challenge was all about transforming her physical appearance. The second was about transforming her life.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I lost 7 pounds* that first week," exclaims Amyra. "But it was at Celebration 2013 when I realized that this is more than
          just a physical transformation. I saw the financial opportunity available with Isagenix and gained a hope for the
          future."
        </p>
        <p>
          The desire to look her best, coupled with her drive to financially give back to her family, drove her to get up each morning
          and work out.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her success became apparent three months into her first Challenge when she slipped back into her pre-pregnancy jeans. Even
          more exciting for Amyra was purchasing her first pair of size 2/4 jeans less than one year after joining Isagenix,
          and after completing her second Challenge—a transformation slim down of six pant sizes.*
        </p>
        <h3>Creating Team Spirit</h3>
        <p>
          Today, this successful Crystal Executive is happier and healthier than she’s ever been. She’s also contributing between $300
          and $900** a month to her family’s household income!
        </p>
        <p>
          "Taking part in the Challenge has established more credibility and more authority in my business than I could ever articulate
          in a conversation," explains Amyra.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her personal and professional goals moving forward are to share the vision and build a team of like-minded people. She also
          wants to help families experience the same financial relief to ultimately live the life they desire.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I start by sharing the cost-saving benefits of the President’s Pak," laughs Amyra. "I spent so much money during my first
          month between ordering the 9-Day System, vitamins and snacks for my kids, and extra products for my husband to
          try. I wish someone would have told me sooner."
        </p>
        <p>
          So, what’s next for this IsaBody Challenge Top Achievers Finalist?
        </p>
        <p>
          "We [my team and I] are currently doing a 90-Day Game Plan," shares Amyra. "I have made a commitment to myself that while
          I continue to wake up everyday at 5 a.m. to work out in preparation for Celebration in August, I will work my business
          just as hard in hopes of achieving 3-Star Golden Circle by then!"
        </p>
        <h3>Tips for Success</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Engage in exercise.</strong> "Just drink the shake and earn your shower!” (Follow the program and engage in any
            exercise that you enjoy that makes you sweat.)</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Focus on today.</strong> Don’t focus on the end goal. It can be overwhelming. Focus on the day and celebrate
            your daily accomplishments. They will accumulate into the big goal achieved!</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Talk to others.</strong> Plug in to the IsaBody community. Take lots of pictures and share your journey. It will

        <h3>Top Achiever Finalist Hopes to ‘Spread the Secret’</h3>
        <p>
          "Many times throughout my life I would turn to food for comfort," reflects Angie, a 2014 IsaBody Challenge® Top Achiever
          Finalist. "The more I ate, the more I gained. The more I gained, the more I tried to shed the weight. The more
          I failed, the more I ate. I was in a vicious cycle and was my own worst enemy."
        </p>
        <p>
          After 20 years of "trying every fad diet under the sun," Angie glanced at her family—the majority who were overweight—and
          chalked it up to genetics.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Let me put it this way: By that time, the only thing I hadn’t done was gastric bypass surgery," shares Angie who was 258
          pounds before being introduced to Isagenix in March 2013.
        </p>
        <h3>Proving a Point</h3>
        <p>
          Angie’s friend, Stephanie, gave her the 30-Day Cleansing and Fat Burning System to prove that Angie could lose the unwanted
          weight with the right tools.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wanting to equally prove to her friend that Isagenix was another "fad diet," Angie was actually pleasantly surprised. The
          products not only worked, but Angie enjoyed the overall simplicity of the system.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Stephanie definitely got me," laughs Angie. "I’m so happy she was right and I was wrong."
        </p>
        <p>
          Since then, Angie went through an outstanding transformation losing 140 pounds.* Her incredible results inspired her father
          to join Isagenix and embark on a similar weight-loss journey. Together, the daughter and father each lost more
          than 100 pounds,* and entered the prestigious 100-Pound Club together.
        </p>
        <h3>Bring It On</h3>
        <p>
          Angie’s a pro at bringing dreams to life. She dreamt of finding the "Angie within" and accomplished that after being asked
          to join the IsaBody Challenge by an Isagenix employee, Ashley, who was inspired by her transformation when she
          lost her first 100 pounds.*
        </p>
        <p>
          Since joining the IsaBody Challenge, the Arizona native lost 28 more pounds and succeeded her goal of reaching her high school
          weight of 125 pounds. Now, Angie’s a happy and healthy 118 pounds, and ready to compete for the title of 2014 IsaBody
          Challenge Grand Prize Winner.*
        </p>
        <p>
          "I think everybody should continuously be in the IsaBody Challenge," expresses Angie. "Because whatever goal you’re trying
          to reach, if you have a tool such as the IsaBody Challenge to hold yourself accountable, no one else can hold you
          accountable except you—it’s your choice."
        </p>
        <p>
          With losing a total of 26 sizes* since joining Isagenix, Angie believes it’s not about the size of your pants that makes
          you a winner—it’s how you feel inside.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I feel fantastic. I look a lot better. I’m years younger. And I’m able to run and play with my children for the first time
          in their whole lives," says Angie, a mother of three. "With this newfound energy, the greatest prize of all is
          that I won my life back."
        </p>
        <h3>Sharing the ‘Secret’</h3>
        <p>
          Now on a daily regime of using the 30-Day System, the 1-Star Golden Circle, Crystal Director has another dream to make a
          reality: inspiring others through her journey of overcoming self-doubt while achieving their peak of wellness.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a Top Achiever Finalist, Angie’s been awarded $3,000 cash, a trip for herself and a guest to 2014 Top Achievers, 2014
          Celebration and a spot aboard the 2014 IsaBody Challenge Transformation Cruise.***
        </p>
        <p>
          "I am definitely associated with Isagenix to help everyone that I can," says Angie. "I mean, I want to shout to the world:
          ‘I found the secret, everybody! Come here; I can help you.’"
        </p>
        <h3>Tips for Success</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Hold yourself accountable.</strong> That way, you don’t blame a friend or spouse or whomever for your actions.
            You have to answer to yourself.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Join multiple Challenges.</strong> Whatever goal you’re trying to reach, if you have a tool such as the IsaBody
            Challenge, it keeps making you better and stronger.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Work straight from the heart.</strong> Find a workout that moves you, put your heart into it, and visualize that
            goal from your heart.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Everything happens for a reason.</strong> We all find ourselves using Isagenix through some personal journey.
            Just know that no matter what happens, it’s there for a reason and use that to empower your goal.</li>

        <h3>Wrestling With An Unhealthy Life</h3>
        <p>
          Collegiate Certified Athletic Trainer coach Ben M. dedicated his life to encouraging the fitness and performance of others.
          But when it came to his own health, he couldn’t quite pin a healthy lifestyle down. "I was obese," recalls Ben.
          "I hold a master’s degree in health and human performance, but I couldn’t take my own health seriously."
        </p>
        <p>
          Ben recalls his earlier years. "I’ve always been an active guy but never a fit guy." He continues, "I was always tired
          and kept sleeping heavily. My hands and feet were always swollen." Ben had a sobering revelation. "I was just
          15 years younger than my dad when he died of a heart attack."
        </p>
        <h3>Tapping Out Early</h3>
        <p>
          Ben confesses he "was tired all the time," especially after the birth of his second daughter. His health continued to deteriorate.
          "I had just returned from a national athletic training convention, and I had health testing done. My biometric
          numbers were out of control, and in the second year, my numbers were even worse."
        </p>
        <p>
          With his health in decline, Ben noticed other disturbing developments. "I was falling asleep every night by 7 p.m. My health
          just wasn’t where I wanted it to be." Ben reached a crucial decision. "If I was going to make a change, it was
          now or never."
        </p>
        <h3>A Nutritional Rematch</h3>
        <p>
          Ben needed help. "I met with, Tryg and Tracy, my athletic trainers from college," he remembers. "Two people I’ve always
          looked up to and respected. They’re always looking good, always into fitness. They suggested Isagenix." It was
          then that Ben decided to take the first step. "I decided to sign up and join Isagenix that night."
        </p>
        <p>
          Ben can hardly contain his passion for the IsaBody Challenge® and committing gave him a whole new perspective. "It got me
          up off the couch and helped me get my health back on track," he says. "It’s awesome!"
        </p>
        <p>
          Ben’s sky-high confidence and impressive results are winning hearts, minds and bodies to Isagenix. "My confidence and my
          results are an inspiration to others, and that," he confides, "feels really good."
        </p>
        <h3>Tackling Healthy New Goals</h3>
        <p>
          Ben is training for the Oklahoma City Memorial Marathon–and that’s just the beginning. "I’m also in the hunt for six-pack
          abs by summer," he shares. "Training is going great—I’m not going to stop until I get them."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I loved getting the IsaBody call," Ben recalls. "Becoming a finalist really motivated me. I’m getting better all the time.
          I’m aiming for 5 percent body fat; I want to look like a sprinter."
        </p>
        <p>
          "My diet has never been this energy-packed," Ben insists. "Nowadays, I can’t wait to work out, and Isagenix is always there
          for me."
        </p>
        <h3>Ben's Tips for Success</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Commit.</strong> Releasing unwanted pounds takes determination, focus and the right nutrition. No matter what
            your IsaBody™ goals, take them seriously.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Stay focused.</strong> Don’t let anything distract you and prevent you from achieving what you want.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Take command.</strong> The Challenge puts you in control. It’s your ship–you’re the Captain. Set a course for
            success and set sail.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Don’t be shy.</strong> Discuss the IsaBody Challenge with everyone you meet. The energy and words that come from
            you will be motivational – and infectious!</li>

        <h3>Top Achievers Finalist and Seasoned Network Marketer Reignites Business</h3>
        <p>
          Before Bob joined the IsaBody Challenge® he had been a business builder for nearly five years, using the Challenge as his
          key enrollment tool.
        </p>
        <p>
          When he was not actively building his business with his wife, Andreja, the two were running their family-owned fine dining
          European restaurant in British Columbia.
        </p>
        <p>
          "We work on average 12 to 16 hours a day, so when we came across Isagenix in April 2009, it was a complete blessing in disguise,"
          shares Bob.
        </p>
        <p>
          They were enjoying some much needed down time on the beach in Mexico when they met Isagenix Millionaires, 16-Star Platinum,
          20-Star Crystal Executives Herb and Patty C.
        </p>
        <p>
          "We found something in Patty and Herb that we didn’t even know we were looking for that day," recalls Bob.
        </p>
        <h3>Pushing the Envelope</h3>
        <p>
          The next day, they enrolled with Isagenix.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the next few years, Bob and his wife became faithful product users, slowly building their business. Everything was good,
          but Bob knew it could be better. He knew if he really wanted to ignite his business, he had to lead by example.
          That’s when he joined the Challenge.
        </p>
        <p>
          He also wanted to put to rest some lurking misconceptions about Isagenix being a fad diet in his area.
        </p>
        <p>
          "My goal was to be one of the first contestants to actually put on weight and to also prove that this system was not a ‘diet,’
          but a true heath and wellness program that will do what you desire."
        </p>
        <p>
          To start his journey, he ordered the Performance President’s Pak. He also carved out one hour a day for the gym—a place Bob
          rarely went despite being fairly fit.
        </p>
        <h3>Building on Momentum</h3>
        <p>
          After a few weeks of combining the products with regular exercise, Bob’s body started to lean out. His results inspired his
          trainer and a few gym goers to also try the products, which also helped to organically grow his business.
        </p>
        <p>
          For Bob, his journey was never about weight loss but instead about weight gain. His motto was simple: Focus on the process
          and results will come.
        </p>
        <p>
          "My motivation came each time I saw the amount of weights I was lifting increase," excites this 2014 Top Achievers Finalist.
          "That was proof I was succeeding."
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to packing on more muscle, another element of Bob’s journey was to inspire others to get healthier.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the end of Bob’s Challenge he had done both: he had gained 8 pounds* and was sporting washboard abs all while igniting
          his business.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently a 5-Star Golden Circle and 4-Star Crystal Executive earning between $280,000 and $417,000 a year,** Bob now speaks
          with confidence when sharing the benefits of the Challenge with others.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Isagenix has also helped bring out the teamwork between my wife and me," adds Bob. "Running a successful restaurant sometime
          means you’re running in opposite directions to get everything done."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, Bob and his wife are encouraging everyone on their team to join the Challenge.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Part of this journey is about discovering a new you," shares Bob. "I love this Challenge for giving me the drive and accountability
          to keep motivated."
        </p>
        <h3>Tips for Success</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Give yourself a break.</strong> Don’t make it so regimented that you set yourself up for failure.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Have an accountability partner.</strong> Ask either someone in the IsaBody Challenge or a trainer to help you
            stick with the program.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Create a motto.</strong> Mine is "Focus on the process and results will come!”</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Have fun!</strong> Approach each day with enthusiasm. People will start to want what you have—this is a business
            building tool when used right.</li>

        <h3>From Wake-Up Call to Weight-Loss Success</h3>
        <p>
          Ask David about life before the IsaBody Challenge®, and he sums it up in one word: unhealthy. "I was eating lots of frozen
          and processed foods," he says. "As I entered my 40s, my health started deteriorating rapidly – high blood pressure,
          a bulging (spinal) disc, sleep apnea – you name it."
        </p>
        <p>
          David, a veteran financial planner from Dubuque, Iowa, recalls a deteriorating state. "My health was unraveling. I was overweight
          and eating unhealthy. Even worse," he confides, "a good friend had passed away who had a lot of similar health
          challenges. He was my age."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I had to either accept dying soon," shares David, "or get off my butt and do something about it." He began to set priorities.
          "You don’t appreciate good health until it’s gone. I was in pain, feeling bad and very unhealthy. It was time for
          a change."
        </p>
        <h3>A Sound Investment in Health</h3>
        <p>
          Determined to reach his goals, David searched for an answer. "I knew I needed help to release excess weight, but I didn’t
          know where to turn," he remembers. David wanted to avoid a medicine cabinet filled with prescription drugs, so
          he decided to do some research to look for a healthier alternative. Shortly after, his doctor asked him if he was
          interested in attending a nutritional seminar.
        </p>
        <p>
          That seminar was an Isagenix presentation. "I went, and I was so impressed, I signed up right away. I trusted my enrolling
          sponsor, so I trusted Isagenix. I just had to try it."
        </p>
        <p>
          For David, the systems were easy to follow. "I followed [them] and watched the weight melt off. In the mirror, I saw the
          fit young man I was in high school returning. It was really exciting."
        </p>
        <h3>IsaBody Closes The Deal</h3>
        <p>
          Soon after joining Isagenix, David signed up for the IsaBody Challenge to hold himself accountable and he has never looked
          back. The IsaBody Challenge gave him inspiration to compete with others. "Since high school football, competition
          has always motivated me," David says. "I was hooked."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I didn’t know what the magic number should be," he adds referring to weight watching, "but I knew I wanted to start feeling
          healthy and fit."
        </p>
        <h3>A Brighter Future</h3>
        <p>
          Ask David today about his life, and his enthusiasm is infectious. "Oh my gosh, everything’s changed!" he says zealously.
          David hoped to lose weight, but he didn’t expect such drastic results in so many arenas. His health, his cardio
          and his physical strength are back.
        </p>
        <p>
          David beams, "Recently, I have met the woman of my dreams. I’ve surrounded myself with positive and empowering people, and
          my life and health now seem to be in balance. I have hope again."
        </p>
        <h3>David's Tips for Success</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Just commit.</strong> When I started, I didn’t start with the IsaBody Challenge being the main reason I joined.
            Even if you don’t want to, do it anyway, because it holds you accountable.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Stay focused on your end goal.</strong> When you know you have pictures and measurements coming up during the
            IsaBody Challenge, believe me, it keeps you accountable.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Share!</strong> I share my IsaBody Challenge story, and others have signed up based purely on hearing my experience.
            Trust the plan completely.</li>

        <h3>Paramedic Makes Life-Changing Decision</h3>
        <p>
          Growing up, Elizabeth was very active. She loved swimming and enjoyed participating in water polo. By 18, her athleticism
          transitioned out of the water and into CrossFit. As an adult, her fit, 170-pound frame made the physical demands
          of her job as a paramedic easier.
        </p>
        <p>
          It wasn’t until she became pregnant with her son and put on bed rest that her weight became an issue.
        </p>
        <p>
          "When I entered the hospital to have my son, I weighed 245 pounds," shares Elizabeth. "When I left, I was still well over
          220 pounds."
        </p>
        <p>
          She had gained 75 pounds in nine short months.
        </p>
        <h3>Running for a Reason</h3>
        <p>
          When her son was six months old, Elizabeth decided to start running—an exercise she never thought she could do, but was determined
          to try. By the time her son turned one, she was running 25 miles a week. Doing all that cardio only dropped Elizabeth’s
          weight to 190 pounds.
        </p>
        <p>
          That’s when she decided to take her friend up on her offer to try the Isagenix 30-Day Cleansing and Fat Burning System.
        </p>
        <p>
          "She shared Isagenix with me while I was pregnant but I wasn’t open to it at the time," adds this California resident.
        </p>
        <p>
          It came to a point during one of her daily runs that she found herself feeding her son snacks and entertaining him with her
          iPad that she realized her workouts were no longer working out.
        </p>
        <h3>Taking Hurdles Head On</h3>
        <p>
          After taking the plunge and ordering the 30-Day System, she also teamed up with her mom and joined the IsaBody Challenge®.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I still remember my first month and losing 23 pounds,"* shares this 2014 Top Achievers Finalist. "That was an incredible
          milestone."
        </p>
        <p>
          By the end of her first Challenge she was down 34 pounds total.*
        </p>
        <p>
          Her hard work earned her Honorable Mention in the 2013 New Year Kick Off Challenge period and the chance to show off her
          sleek new physique onstage at our yearly event. Her transformation not only inspired others, but their vote of
          confidence inspired Elizabeth to sign up for another Challenge.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the end of her subsequent, back-to-back Challenge, Elizabeth released an additional 10 pounds. More importantly, she went
          from 39 percent to 16 percent body fat and released 80 inches from her body.*
        </p>
        <p>
          Her journey encouraged those around her to join Isagenix, which in turn, ignited her business.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because of her success, she has been able to step away from her 56-hour work week and substitute it with the money she’s
          making in her Isagenix business.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, this 1-Star Golden Circle, Crystal Executive, who earns between $28,000 and $53,000 a year,** teaches paramedic school
          twice a month—not because she has to, but because she wants to!
        </p>
        <h3>Tips for Success</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Commit!</strong> Make a commitment to yourself. Making a life change is not something you can do for anyone but
            yourself!
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Stick with it.</strong> Know that everyone has days when they struggle. Do not let what happened yesterday shape
            today.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Have fun.</strong> Reward yourself along the way by trying new classes and even new activities.</li>

        <h3>Celebration Finalist and IsaDerby Winner Envisions a Brighter Future</h3>
        <p>
          "I have struggled with my weight for years. Even though I was doing the right things, eating well and exercising, I wasn’t
          seeing results," admits 43-year-old Erin. "There were constant food cravings and I found myself overeating and
          overdrinking. So of course I was frustrated, exhausted and had very low energy." This mother of two always had
          a desire to help others. For fifteen years she served as a school counse-lor and mindset coach.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I loved working with children at school," reflects Erin. "But I always had a bigger vision, I wanted to contribute on
          a bigger scale. I wanted more income for my family, and I valued my time freedom. Even more, I wanted to spend
          that time with my family and enjoy the prospect that life is open to you."
        </p>
        <p>
          With her husband, Geoff, in the Canadian Air Force, Erin and her daughters were constantly on the go. Within a few years,
          the family had moved across the country four different times.
        </p>
        <p>
          Emotionally and physically, Erin was spent.
        </p>
        <h3>Health is No. 1</h3>
        <p>
          "My friend, Wendy, suggested I do a cleanse," recalls Erin. "I didn’t know anything about it, but knew that I needed to
          transform my health—that was number one, because I kept doing everything by my-self and that just wasn’t working."
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2011, Erin went on the 30-Day Cleansing and Fat Burning System and lost noticeable weight in the first month.* With the
          support of Wendy and other Isagenix Associates, Erin felt emotionally support-ed to achieve her goals.
        </p>
        <p>
          "After the cleanse, I felt energized and my sleep was much better," says Erin. "I felt amazing and hadn’t felt like this
          before."
        </p>
        <p>
          She continued to purchase the products when she realized that she could reap the benefits of Isagenix to help create income.
        </p>
        <p>
          "My first goal was to get my products paid for, which I did in my first few weeks," explains Erin. "Then I set a goal to
          get a new car. And the next week I did."
        </p>
        <p>
          In her first year, Erin made $100,000.** The now 5-Star Golden Circle, 4 star Crystal Executive had so many goals and visions
          for her future, that she aimed to win IsaDerby™ in her first year.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I was the number one point earner in 2011 and have been to IsaDerby three years in a row," exclaims Erin. "It’s the same
          solid mindset to win IsaDerby that got me to the IsaBody finals."
        </p>
        <h3>Envisioning A Better Future</h3>
        <p>
          "Every year I would join the IsaBody Challenge®, but never completed it," reflects Erin about her health journey. "That
          first year I kept my weight off and felt great. And then my second year, we moved across the country and I just
          got so focused on building my business that my life got out of balance."
        </p>
        <p>
          It was during that time that Erin stopped exercising and taking care of herself.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I think it was fear of losing my business," admits Erin. "It was the fear of it going away or I guess I had to build trust
          that this was going to stay." She knew that she had to beat this perspective and envisioned a new goal for herself.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I made the decision that I wanted to represent Isagenix in all areas: as an athlete, as a woman who’s aging in a healthy
          way, and as a woman who’s making income for her family," says Erin.
        </p>
        <p>
          In January 2014, Erin wrote a note on a recipe card about the person she wanted to become.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I want to be an IsaBody Finalist. I want to get into elite shape. I want to be a woman who does not apologize for who she
          is. A women who follows through," wrote Erin.
        </p>
        <p>
          By successfully competing in the IsaBody Challenge, Erin released 24 pounds.* Now at 5’6" and 134 pounds,* she feels like
          the person she’s always wanted to become.
        </p>
        <p>
          "The biggest thing that the IsaBody Challenge has taught me is that my future has unlimited potential," emphasizes Erin.
          "Before, I had a lot of fear about the future. And now the biggest change is that I’m excited about it!"
        </p>

        <h3>U.S. Military Veteran Takes on New Challenge</h3>
        <p>
          Jason was attached to the special operations unit in the U.S. Army in the 1990s. Back then, his life was about traveling
          the world, participating in various military operations and experiencing unbelievable journeys.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I was living the adventure and my dream," says the now 39-year-old Jason. "Back then, I really thought I was in the best
          shape of my life. Being in top physical and mental condition was essential to being a soldier because you never
          knew what was around the corner."
        </p>
        <p>
          When he returned home to the United States after eight honorable years of service, Jason couldn’t help but feel a "sadness
          in his heart."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I missed the recognition for doing well," shares Jason. "A lot of times, you just don’t get that in the civilian sector."
        </p>
        <h3>Adjusting Back to the Norm</h3>
        <p>
          Shortly after his discharge, he began working as a supervisor in a warehouse in his home state of New York, and then later
          in Durham, North Carolina. That’s when he started developing some not-so-healthy habits—including smoking and poor
          eating.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Within 10 years as a supervisor, my health started to deteriorate," reflects Jason. "I had undergone three abdominal hernia
          surgeries between 2006 and 2011. My life and self-worth were at an all-time low. Deep down, I knew I wasn’t doing
          what I was meant to do."
        </p>
        <p>
          At only 5’4", Jason tipped the scale at 215 pounds.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I would stand in once place and literally be crushed under my own weight," he admits. "I couldn’t even bend over and tie
          my shoes due to weight gain. Obviously, that’s not the best place to be."
        </p>
        <p>
          After a divorce, custody battle and resigning from the warehouse industry, Jason knew the negative signs were meant for him
          to turn his life around.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I just let life get to me and thought: ‘I need to take control,’" says Jason.
        </p>
        <h3>Regaining Life</h3>
        <p>
          In September of 2012, Jason’s now-fiancé, Sandra, introduced him to Isagenix and the IsaBody Challenge®.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I saw the IsaBody Challenge as a chance for me to make my mark in a positive way—not only to improve my health and wellness,
          but to be able to inspire others to have the courage to embark on their own journey," says Jason. "The Challenge
          gave me an opportunity to look in the mirror and make myself the person who I’ve always wanted to become."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, Jason is 163 pounds and went from a size 40 to a 29.*
        </p>
        <p>
          "I haven’t been that size since I was a freshman in high school," exclaims Jason.
        </p>
        <p>
          What impresses Jason most about the Challenge isn’t the weight loss—it’s the friendships and recognition gained that reminded
          him of Army camaraderie.
        </p>
        <p>
          "As time grew, it became clear to me that Isagenix is more than a Challenge," explains Jason. "The people you meet—that
          touched your heart, that inspired you and that you’ve been inspired by—it’s just tremendous. You see that same
          comradeship in the military and I appreciate how that is reflected in Isagenix. You think, ‘How everybody wants
          you to succeed and how can you turn that down?’"
        </p>
        <p>
          Jason now no longer carries the nostalgia from the Army, finally realizing that it’s time to start a new chapter in life.
        </p>
        <p>
          "My biggest milestone throughout the IsaBody Challenge was that I had no desire to fall on those crutches: the smoking and
          the excessive eating. That’s all gone now."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now Jason is focused on achieving the positive life that he never knew he could have.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Isagenix is a lifestyle change," says Jason. "And I love explaining to people that there’s nothing out there worth having
          if you don’t work hard for it. That’s what the IsaBody Challenge did for me."
        </p>

        <h3>Former Trainer Finds Path Back To Glory</h3>
        <p>
          Jennifer was always on the go. An avid athlete, she worked diligently to keep her weight in check – until she hit her 30s
          when her weight started to slowly creep up. "My weight yo-yoed, up, then down, then up again," she says. "I was
          all over the map."
        </p>
        <p>
          Jennifer remembers her early career and her deep connection to physical fitness. After receiving her honors degree in Fitness
          and Lifestyle Management, Jennifer worked as a personal trainer throughout her 20s. However, even with her passion
          for fitness, her health-and-wellness challenges started to mount.
        </p>
        <h3>Going to the Dogs</h3>
        <p>
          Jennifer recalls when things began to change. "My life went to the dogs," she says, "literally." Steering away from her
          health and fitness roots, she made a drastic lifestyle change. She moved north from the city of Toronto out to
          the country and began raising Alaskan Malamutes and became a professional dog trainer and groomer.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I spent lots of time on the road, going to dog shows and competitions," she says. "Everything I did was for the sake of
          my dogs’ performances." She discusses the sacrifices and eventual toll of her commitment, "I didn’t exercise
          or make healthy food choices, and my figure paid the price."
        </p>
        <h3>Isagenix Unleashed</h3>
        <p>
          Jennifer decided to kick a new healthy, Isagenix-powered lifestyle into high gear. "A close friend from college, Tinya G.,
          was doing something really remarkable with Isagenix," Jennifer recalls, "I decided to find out more."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Tinya hosted Isagenix parties at her house and was clearly doing something to turn her life around," Jennifer says. "I
          finally reached out to her," Jennifer admits, "but I was very apprehensive. When I discovered the healthy nutrition
          in the products, though, I just knew I’d be wowed by the results."
        </p>
        <p>
          By day four of her first 30-Day Cleansing and Fat Burning System, she became a true believer, both of the product and the
          business. "I’ve always been receptive to network marketing," Jennifer says. "When I discovered Isagenix, I knew
          I found my home."
        </p>
        <h3>From Mush to Muscle</h3>
        <p>
          When she committed to the IsaBody Challenge, Jennifer was once again driven. "It’s a complete 180-degree change," she shares,
          discussing her transformation due to the IsaBody Challenge.
        </p>
        <p>
          The goals she set for herself at the start of the Challenge helped her get serious about completing it. "When I started this
          Challenge, I discussed the importance of completing it with an Associate on another team," she says. "That really
          helped me focus."
        </p>
        <h3>Success of the Highest Pedigree</h3>
        Isagenix started as a weight release journey for Jennifer, but it has turned into so much more. "I did three 30-Day Cleansing
        and Fat Burning Systems back-to-back to lose the initial weight," she says. "I’ve gained amazing strength, incredible
        energy and unheard-of recovery levels. I thank the products and my training and focus in the IsaBody Challenge for
        that."
        <p>
          Jennifer has now retired from her career as a dog groomer, but continues to breed and show dogs as a hobby. "Isagenix is
          my career now," she says. "Inspiring others to get the very best from life makes me more passionate about my
          own journey."
        </p>
        <h3>Jennifer's Tips for Success</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Don’t wait for the perfect time to start the IsaBody Challenge – start now!</li>
          <li>It starts with baby steps toward a goal you set you yourself – look to make daily progress, and celebrate every
            triumph, big or small.</li>

        <h3>Top Achievers Finalist Discovers Confidence at 60</h3>
        <p>
          "Internally, I felt confident," shares Judy, a 2014 IsaBody Challenge Top Achievers Finalist. "But externally, I held back
          and was unsure of my actions, second guessing myself all the time."
        </p>
        <p>
          For the past 10 years, the Ontario native spent her time as a body-oriented psychotherapist. Helping others create strong
          mental health was a lifelong goal for Judy since childhood. But eventually, guiding individuals to work through
          their trauma got the best of her, despite Judy’s dream of caring for others.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I think the biggest part of the IsaBody Challenge has been the belief that you can do what you want to do to make a difference
          in the lives of yourself, your family and the people around and in the world at large," reflects Judy, now a
          2-Star Golden Circle, Executive. "Yet, once I started believing in myself and gaining strength through the Challenge,
          I saw that I could actually make a bigger change in the world."
        </p>
        <h3>Making the Change</h3>
        <p>
          Clearly, working in the world of distress took its toll on Judy, who was 5’5" and a size 12 at 138 pounds before discovering
          Isagenix in 2007.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I was emotionally and physically exhausted," says this mother of two and wife of 23 years to her husband, Jim. "Even with
          strong boundaries between work and family, I became moody, struggled with weight gain and knew that I was in trouble."
        </p>
        <p>
          Confiding in her friend, Dr. Rick, about her inner feelings, he gave Judy the tools toward a rejuvenated life. After introducing
          her to the 30-Day Cleansing and Fat Burning System, Judy released 22 pounds in five weeks.*
        </p>
        <p>
          "I felt great, but after using Isagenix for seven years, I still felt delicate inside," says Judy. "I knew that I needed
          to find my strength through confidence. I needed to physically ramp it up in order to show others what’s possible
          when you focus on healthy living and aging gracefully."
        </p>
        <h3>Dispelling a 'Myth'</h3>
        <p>
          Before turning 60 in August 2013, Judy decided to join the IsaBody Challenge. Now the lean 116-pound Judy is a size two*
          and has discovered her inner confidence through external strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I’m honored to be a finalist," says Judy. "What gave me the strength was the idea to dispel the myth that when you turn
          60, you’re starting to slow down. Somehow, being physically strong allowed me to recognize that this was the real
          me. This is the one that didn’t have to second guess herself."
        </p>
        <p>
          As a Top Achiever Finalist, Judy’s been awarded $3,000 cash, a trip for herself and a guest to 2014 Top Achievers, 2014 Celebration
          and a spot aboard the 2014 IsaBody Challenge Transformation Cruise.***
        </p>
        <p>
          "I feel like I’m an ambassador for the company since I became a finalist," reveals Judy. "I’ve had people turn to me and
          let me know that I inspire them—and to me, that is so powerful. It means that I have to live every single day to
          be the best that I can be."
        </p>
        <h3>Tips for Success</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Make a commitment.</strong> Tell everyone that you’re completing a goal. That way, there’s no turning back once
            you’ve said it out loud.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Believe in yourself.</strong> You’ll always go through areas of self-doubt and diminishing willpower, but always
            believe that you can accomplish your goal.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Stick to consistent and persistent action.</strong> Never give up and focus on what is possible.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Find a partner to get you through this.</strong> My husband helped me through my last Challenge and then decided
            to get on board. I enjoy being a guide as to how he should approach the program.</li>

        <h3>Marching To The Beat Of A New Drummer</h3>
        <p>
          Your world can change in an instant. Few know this as well as IsaBody Challenge® Finalist, Randy. "Unlike a lot of others,
          I didn’t struggle with my weight when I was growing up," confesses the retired 20-year Army veteran. "At least
          not at first."
        </p>
        <p>
          Randy recalls his youth. "I was always fit; I played football at Oklahoma State University. I had no desire to go into the
          military," he confesses, "but in the early 1970s, scholarship athletes had to be in ROTC. Thus after graduation,
          I entered the Army. I even served on General Schwarzkopf’s medical staff during Desert Storm."
        </p>
        <h3>Being All He Could Be</h3>
        <p>
          After the Army, Randy was recruited to take a job in the healthcare industry. "I took a position as a Managed Care Director
          for Colorado, Kansas and Oklahoma. He explains, "I was overqualified but took the job." Although Randy excelled,
          he shortly found out what "At Will" meant.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, things took a turn.
        </p>
        <p>
          "After I was let go, I went into a downward spiral," Randy recalls, "I was devastated and it impacted my family." Life
          began to unravel. "Every subsequent year my waistline kept up with my age. I had a hard time functioning." Randy’s
          ongoing weight gain and health issues became a growing concern for his family.
        </p>
        <h3>A Turn for the Worse</h3>
        <p>
          With a new career as a mortgage broker and health obstacles mounting, Randy’s health–and morale–worsened. "Just getting out
          of bed and doing basic life activities exhausted me. My family feared I was heading for a heart attack."
        </p>
        <p>
          Never one to quit, Randy was determined to reshape his destiny. "I was eager to make some positive changes," he confides.
          "I needed to get my life back."
        </p>
        <h3>Enter: The Isagenix Cavalry</h3>
        <p>
          Concerned for his health, Randy’s wife suggested speaking to a friend. "Julie is a friend of my wife living in Florida. She
          recommended Isagenix." Isagenix was exactly what he was looking for. "The first time I tried the 30-Day Cleansing
          and Fat Burning System, I lost 29 pounds."* I was astonished by the results." Then, Randy discovered the IsaBody
          Challenge®.
        </p>
        <h3>Back to Basic Training</h3>
        <p>
          Randy excels at what he sets his mind to. "I’ve always been a top achiever. As an IsaBody Challenge Finalist," he beams,
          "my transformation transcended across my weight loss, healthy aging, and energy and performance goals. I now plan
          to transform my financial status by sharing Isagenix with everyone!"
        </p>
        <p>
          Randy’s self-esteem is back. "After NYKO, I’m ready!" He shares other milestones. "My workouts have more energy than ever.
          I have more confidence than I’ve had in years."
        </p>
        <p>
          Randy looks forward to building his Isagenix business. "When I work out, people come up and ask, ‘Is this really true or
          how are you doing this?’ I tell them, ‘Yes, it’s Isagenix.’" He wears a T-shirt with how much weight he’s released
          printed on it. "In the gym, others come up and share their struggles and tell me what an inspiration I am to them.
          I’m looking great and best of all," he says confidently, "I feel like a winner!"
        </p>
        <h3>Randy's Tips for Success</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Make a decision and commit to your goals and dreams. Write them down and have them in realistic bite-sized chunks.

        <h3>Part-time Administrator Looks Fabulous at 50</h3>
        <p>
          After deciding to leave a very unhealthy relationship, Shelagh knew she needed time to rebuild her life and her self-esteem.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her best friend suggested Isagenix knowing its products’ ability to boost energy and endurance.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I said ‘no’ for the first few months," admits Shelagh. "I just couldn’t open up to it."
        </p>
        <p>
          During that time, her moods would fluctuate from high to low and her energy was completely deflated. She knew if she didn’t
          pull herself up, she would eventually lose her job as an administrator for a condominium developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Coming to that realization opened Shelagh’s mind to trying Isagenix.
        </p>
        <h3>Opening Up To Isagenix</h3>
        <p>
          "By my third day on the Pacesetter Pak I was already feeling more motivated and uplifted," shares Shelagh. "I felt positive
          and full of energy, but I knew I needed all the support I could get to follow through."
        </p>
        <p>
          So, she also signed up for the IsaBody Challenge®.
        </p>
        <p>
          "It was a 16-week goal and I couldn’t give up," explains Shelagh, "because I knew other people were doing it too."
        </p>
        <p>
          Within her first few weeks on the products, Shelagh released 10 pounds* and felt healthier and stronger than she had in a
          while.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once she saw what the products could do for her body, she was open to meeting the people of Isagenix and attended an opportunity
          meeting in Toronto. Inspired, she embarked on a new journey, building an Isagenix business, and decided to use
          the Challenge as her platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          While her success was fast moving, one thing still lingered in her mind.
        </p>
        <h3>Finishing What You Start</h3>
        <p>
          "I wrote in my first Challenge essay that ‘I’m considering a Figure Competition at 50, fueled by Isagenix,’" shares Shelagh.
        </p>
        <p>
          With that goal still in limbo, she entered her second Challenge and set a firm goal to compete in a figure competition in
          May of 2014.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to her daily Isagenix products, Shelagh added extra Ionix® Supreme, Product B®, omega-3 essential fatty acids,
          Isagenix Greens!™ and IsaPro® for a boost in nutrition.
        </p> 
        <p>
          "What I began to notice was that even though I had not weight trained in over five years, I was astounded by how much I could
          lift," admits Shelagh, "how fast I recovered from my workouts, how much energy I still had, and how balanced
          I felt."
        </p>
        <h3>Fabulous at 50</h3>
        <p>
          In total, Shelagh ended up releasing 35 pounds since starting her Isagenix journey and whittled her waist line to slip into
          a size zero pair of jeans.*
        </p>
        <p>
          She also fulfilled her original goal, taking second place in her category at the fitness competition proving she could look
          fabulous at 50!
        </p>
        <h3>Tips for Success</h3>

        <h3>Third Time’s the Charm for Thai’s Transformation</h3>
        <p>
          At 5’1", Thai often blended into the background. Something he didn’t mind, especially since he wasn’t 100 percent comfortable
          with his body. "Any extra pound looks like five on my frame," he shares. At a starting weight of 148 pounds,
          Thai was healthy and athletic, but his physique was far from ideal.
        </p>
        <p>
          He routinely worked out hard and even drank protein shakes, but he didn’t have a solid system and he wasn’t seeing lasting
          results. At 40, his athletic endeavors—like two-day volleyball tournaments and 10k races—left him exhausted and
          sore.
        </p>
        <h3>Starting the System</h3>
        <p>
          In 2011, Thai was introduced to Isagenix with the 9-Day Cleansing and Fat Burning System. He was about to go on vacation
          and wanted to trim down. The system helped him shed some torso fat and reveal the abs underneath. His success led
          him to try a 30-Day Cleansing and Fat Burning System and eventually the Energy and Performance System. He knew
          Isagenix worked for him, he’d even entered the IsaBody Challenge a few times, but it wasn’t until this year that
          he actually completed a Challenge. For him, his third try was the charm.
        </p>
        <h3>Seeing Results</h3>
        <p>
          Thai went into his third IsaBody Challenge determined (and prepared) to succeed. He created a vision board to help him stay
          focused on his goal, checked in with Barbara (his Isagenix mentor) weekly and scheduled everything. Every day Thai
          knew how many days were left in the Challenge, when he needed to eat and what he’d be doing for a workout.
        </p>
        <p>
          It all paid off. Thai earned a spot as one of the top five Celebration IsaBody Challenge finalists. He’ll appear onstage
          at our 2014 Celebration event as one of 15 finalists who could win the Grand Prize, valued at over $25,000.
        </p>
        <p>
          But that’s not all Thai’s won. He’s more confident than he’s ever been. He has more energy and recovers faster than he ever
          has (and faster than some of his younger teammates). He’s started an Isagenix business and is enjoying meeting
          new people and sharing the products that fueled his success. Thai also took on something new. He competed in his
          first-ever bodybuilding competition where he placed sixth, among competitors that, in some cases, have been training
          for years!
        </p>
        <p>
          "I noticed that people backstage at the competition who weren’t using Isagenix were tired and cranky," Thai recalls. He,
          on the other hand, "was full of energy, feeling good and ready to go." And, that’s the way he feels every day,
          thanks to Isagenix.
        </p>
        <h3>Tips for Success</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Use the System.</strong> The system works. Trust it and use it consistently.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Don’t Go it Alone.</strong> You need a support system to successfully complete the Challenge. It really helps
            to work with someone who has completed the Challenge. Check in regularly and share your success as you go!</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Visualize Success.</strong> To be successful, you must first have a goal to work toward. Create a vision board
            that captures your personal goals so you can envision the outcome of the challenge.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Stick to a Schedule.</strong> The IsaBody Challenge is only 16 weeks long. Create and stick to a schedule (eating,
            working out, etc.) so you can stay on track to complete the Challenge and achieve your goals.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>‘Will’ Power Made the Difference</h3>
        <p>
          "As a kid, I was overweight," shares Will. "In high school, I played baseball—overweight. It wasn’t until I was 16 years
          old that I really started to take an interest in diet and exercise."
        </p>
        <p>
          His determination to fit in and shed those unwanted pounds provided him with a platform to rely on himself and become his
          own teacher.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I went on to play college baseball," adds Will. "That opportunity allowed me to focus on my nutrition and uncover my true
          passion: health and wellness."
        </p>
        <p>
          With health and fitness at his very core, Will embarked on a new journey and entered the realm of bodybuilding.
        </p>
        <h3>Falling Off Track</h3>
        <p>
          "I wanted to compete in bodybuilding, not to become a bodybuilder," explains Will, "but, to be a fitness role model to others."
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the next year and a half Will competed in eight men’s physique competitions, which required he eat six times a day.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Your diet regimen is insane," shares Will. "It’s an unrealistic lifestyle."
        </p>
        <h3>Eventually Something Had to Give</h3>
        <p>
          "I needed a break," explains Will. "I needed a couple of months to mentally regroup. I was overworked, overtired, and over
          my extreme dieting. That’s when it all came back—all the body fat I had worked so hard to lose."
        </p>
        <p>
          Coincidently, Will’s friends had just shared Isagenix with him.
        </p>
        <h3>Powered By Others</h3>
        <p>
          "Because I give everything a chance, I agreed to look into the company," shares Will. "I looked into the science, checked
          out the ingredients and perused the products; and, because I really trusted those I surround myself with, I decided
          to put the stuff to the test."
        </p>
        <p>
          With that, he decided to train for another competition and use Isagenix products to prepare.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I was going to push these products to the limit and test them on myself," laughs Will.
        </p>
        <p>
          He started with the IsaPro®. Then, he slowly added in Ionix® Supreme.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I was doing two meals and two meal replacement shakes with either IsaLean® Pro or IsaPro every day," says Will. "I also
          did a few Cleanse Days."
        </p>
        <h3>Customized Success</h3>
        <p>
          Because of the high daily protein intake Will needed to sustain training, he customized his program, yet still adhered to
          two shakes a day. He also joined the IsaBody Challenge®.
        </p>
        <p>
          "The typical 30-Day Cleansing and Fat Burning System wasn’t enough food for me. I needed more," explains Will. "Plus, it
          typically takes 16 weeks to prepare for a national level competition; and the Challenge is 16 weeks. I though it
          was the perfect way to hold myself accountable."
        </p>
        <p>
          By the time Will stepped on stage to compete in the men’s physique category he had chiseled out his physique. He also released
          31.9 pounds* since joining Isagenix.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was so impressed with his results he couldn’t stop talking about the products and decided to take advantage of the business
          opportunity with his girlfriend and current 2014 Miss Arizona title holder, Savanna Troupe.
        </p>
        <p>
          "The biggest difference between training now versus in the past has been the convenience of the products," shares Will, "and,
          to be able to introduce something as convenient as an Isagenix system has been a game changer for me and most of
          my clients."
        </p>
        <h3>Tips for Success</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Have fun.</strong> Have fun and enjoy the goal you are trying to attain. Find an exercise that you like and find
            enjoyable. Everybody’s goals are different.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Stick with it.</strong> Find something convenient to follow; it’s a lifestyle change not a diet.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Take action.</strong> Stop planning and preparing, just start!</li>
