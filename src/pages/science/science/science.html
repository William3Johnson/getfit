            Behind any great health-and-wellness company, there have to be great products. And behind those great products, there has
            to be an experienced yet forward-thinking team of knowledgeable and skilled experts. Isagenix is no exception
            to this rule.
          </p>
          <p>
            Scientists at Isagenix work tirelessly to research and develop product formulas based on the most advanced scientific findings
            and technologies to provide you with the safest and most effective product solutions delivering optimal benefits.
          </p>

            Isagenix Research and Development couldn’t happen without the QRTS department (QRTS stands for Quality, Regulatory, Technology,
            and Science), which consists of numerous scientists—including nutritionists, dietitians, food scientists, chemists,
            organic chemists, microbiologists, toxicologists, and biologists. Through the collaboration of John Anderson,
            Isagenix Founder and Product B™ Formula Developer, expertise from health professionals on our Scientific Advisory
            Board, and esteemed scientists at highly respected universities, we ensure that “real results??? are at the heart
            of every product.
