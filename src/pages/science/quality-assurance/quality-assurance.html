        <h1>Quality Assurance</h1>
        <p>
          As it should be, your safety is our first priority at Isagenix. Having safe, effective, no- compromise products means cutting
          no corners when it comes to selecting and testing raw materials, following the appropriate regulatory guidelines,
          and verifying that the finished products meet purity and composition standards.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Isagenix no-compromise Ingredient Policy is extensive and thorough, covering every detail from ingredient sourcing to
          manufacturing guidelines. By following these principles, Isagenix stands by its products with confidence. After
          all, quality ingredients could mean the difference between products having no effect on health or delivering amazing
          results.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Isagenix, raw materials are only sourced from suppliers with a proven track record of sustainability and exceptional quality.
          No-compromise quality doesnâ€™t stop after raw materials have been selected. When the ingredients are delivered to
          the manufacturing facility, there are strict guidelines called current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs), which
          outline how materials are handled. Isagenix works to ensure that all products meet or exceed the highest standards
          of cGMPs for dietary supplements as outlined by the FDA and other international regulatory boards.
        </p>
        <p>
          Isagenix policy requires that every raw material that arrives in the manufacturing facilities be immediately quarantined,
          thoroughly inspected, and tested for:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li> Identity (botanicals and phytochemicals)</li>
          <li>Strength and composition</li>
          <li>Organoleptic properties (taste, color, odor, and texture)</li>
        </ul>
        <p> Testing to confirm safety and purity of raw materials is very extensive. Rigorous testing is performed for:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li> Microbial activity: total aerobic bacterial, yeast and mold, salmonella and E. coli strains, and other bacterial
            strains</li>
          <li> Pesticides, herbicides, and fungicides</li>
          <li>Heavy metals: all botanicals are tested for the presence of lead, mercury, cadmium, and arsenic</li>
          <li> PCBs and dioxins: each batch of fish oil is third-party tested to confirm undetectable levels of heavy metals,
            PCBs, and dioxins</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Any raw materials that do not meet these standardized testing methods are rejected or destroyed. In addition to testing raw
          materials, Isagenix is unique in that we also thoroughly evaluate the efficacy of finished products. This includes
          re-analyzing the product for identity and purity. Third-party claims testing on vitamin and mineral content is
          also conducted to ensure that our products fully meet what is stated on the labels.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, stability testing confirms that the strength and composition as indicated on the label of the product is accurate
          up until at least the expiration date.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are few other companies that can stand by their quality assurance commitment. By putting this much care into their
          products, you can rest assured that Isagenix is putting the health of our customers first.
        </p>
        <p>
          The team also contributes to evidence-based nutrition research by partnering with several well-respected universities in
          funding and conducting clinical studies. These include University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), Arizona State University,
          University of Maryland, Skidmore College, University of Colorado, and more. For example, UIC conducted a clinical
          study involving Isagenix products that was published in two peer-reviewed journals (Nutrition Journal and Nutrition
          & Metabolism). The study serves as clinical substantiation for Isagenix systems for healthy weight loss and also
          adds to advance our understanding of the relationship between diet, nutrition and health.
